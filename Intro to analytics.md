# Analytics?

As human beings in the digital age, most of us would probably have encountered the word analytics. It originates from the Greek term, *analyein*[^1], which means to release, or set free. While the term has existed for a long time, it has only been popular in 2010's. It's a fairly modern term. You can argue that it's even more modern than computers or the internet. It's one of the recent trends brought about by the age of information. The term analytics is usually used within the context of **data** analytics. The same context we are using in this course.

Analytics is the process of collecting, preparing, and modeling data for the purposes of revealing useful insights. Data just lying around is not useful to anyone. It is through analytics where we can make use of said data to solve problems, understand concepts, reveal patterns, or predict the future. We can go back to the Greek origin of analytics. We use analytics as a tool to release or set free insights underneath data.

At it its core, analytics is converting data into insights. Insights which come in the form patterns, forecasts, relationships, decisions or trends. Analytics help us condense complex information into a single number (statistics) or present complex information into a beautiful and intuitive chart (visualization).

# We have been using analytics for a while now

#### Scientific Management

While the term analytics in its current context is a few decades old, our greatest minds have been using analytics as tools for a while now. Back then we didn't call it analytics. During the industrial age where economic efficiency was the trend, Frederick W. Taylor had the idea to use data and math to improve a factory's production. Taylor called the theory *Scientific Management*. Taylor's theory was successful in improving productivity while lessening worker hours. Scientific Management shows how even before we were using computers, we have been using analytics.



#### Tabulating Machine

Speaking of computer's, around the 1890's, Herman Hollerith, invented one of the first mechanical computation devices. This machine was called the *Tabulating Machine*. It was meant to solve the tedious process of processing US census data. A task which took 8 years to complete manually. This machine showed how our demands for analytics have outgrown our brains' computation capabilities. There is so much data to process that we need now need the help of machines.

#### Spreadsheets

Around the 1960's software for processing large tabulated data known as electronic spreadsheets were created. Some of the earliest versions of these software were the LANPAR (LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random), Autoplan/Autotab. These early versions were improved with the proliferation of more powerful computers like VisiCalc for the Apple II, SuperCalc,  and Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. Around the 1980's the most widely known spreadsheet software was released, the Microsoft Excel.

#### Big Data

With the arrival of the internet, data became more and more available. We started to realize the power of information. Data and analytics became so in demand that we started to dedicate our most powerful computational machines to processing data. Data has become so big that it doesn't even fit into the storage devices of consumer electronics. This paved the way for cloud storage and cloud computing.

#### Analytics Today

##### Business Intelligence

Business is one of the first domains where analytics is used. Just like how Fredrick Taylor used analytics to reveal insights to improve factory productivity, businesses all around the world do the same. Analytics is used to:

- Reveal ideal customer profiles,
- Predict the impact of marketing campaigns,
- Assessing the risks of business decisions

##### Sports

If you follow sports, you might have noticed the rise of the use of analytics in professional sports. Sports organizations have now started to hire data analysts to maintain a competitive edge. Using analytics, sports organizations have started to use advanced metrics:

- assess athlete impact, 
- predict match outcomes, 
- optimize training programs,
- prevent injuries

##### Governance

Just like how the Tabulating Machine was used to process census data for the US Government, analytics is being used to improve governance. With the support of analytics, government organizations

- formulate efficient projects, 
- pass helpful legislations,
- process population data

##### Education

Analytics in education is used to 

- build effective standardized assessments, 
- compare pedagogical methods, 
- improve curriculum
- predict student outcomes
