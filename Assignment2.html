<p>The final project (which also corresponds to your final assessment grade) will require you to submit a data analytics project.
More details regarding the final project requirements will be posted in the future. 
For now, as an assignment, you and your assigned group will be compiling a list of project proposals for approval.
Here are the requirements for the proposals:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li><p>Source of the dataset (a link to the where the dataset was downloaded or the source where the data was acquired)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description and background of the dataset</p>
<ul>
<li>What do each sample in the dataset correspond to?</li>
<li>How was the data collected? (if this information is available)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Number of samples in the dataset</p>
</li>
<li><p>Number of features in the dataset</p>
</li>
<li><p>List of features, with descriptions for each feature</p>
</li>
<li><p>Insights you are interested in finding from the dataset (descriptive insights or predictive insights)</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>You will need to submit <strong>at least three</strong> proposals.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example proposal:</p>
<h1 id='seoul-bike-sharing-demand-dataset'>Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset</h1>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: UCI Machine Learning Repository, <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand' target='_blank' class='url'>https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand</a></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is a dataset collected from a Seoul bike sharing service on Seoul Korea.
Each row in the dataset represents an hour rentals for the service.
The data is collected from a combination of bike sharing services and weather sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Number of samples</strong>: 8760 samples</p>
<p><strong>Number of features</strong>: 13 features</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date: The corresponding date of the sample</li>
<li>Rented Bike Count: (quantitative) The number of bike rentals for this hour.</li>
<li>Hour: (quantitative) The hour of day (0 - 23) of the sample</li>
<li>Temperature: (quantitative) The temperature measured for the hour</li>
<li>Humidity: (quantitative) The humidity measured for the hour</li>
<li>Wind speed: (quantitative) The wind speed measured for the hour</li>
<li>Visibility: (quantitative) The visibility measured for the hour</li>
<li>Dew point temperature: (quantitative) The dew point temp measured for the hour</li>
<li>Solar Radiation: (quantitative) The solar radiation measured for the hour</li>
<li>Rainfall: (quantitative) The rainfall measured for the hour</li>
<li>Snowfall: (quantitative) The snowfall measured for the hour</li>
<li>Season: (qualitative) The current season for the hour</li>
<li>Functioning Day: (qualitative) whether or not the service was function during this day. (1 for a functioning day, 0 for a non-functioning day)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Insights</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which day of the week experience the highest demand of bike sharing rentals?</li>
<li>Do bike rentals increase on colder weather?</li>
<li>Do bike rentals increase on holidays?</li>

</ul>
